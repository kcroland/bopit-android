# Bop It Android
> 'Bop It Android' is a mobile version of Bop It (with some extra features) created in Android Studio.
The tutorial has not been implemented at this time, so please read below for the gestures to use for each image

## How To Play
## ![bopping arrow](app/src/main/res/drawable/bop_arrow.png) **bop it!**
Hold the device out in front of you (screen up and facing you) and slap down like you were trying
to smush a bug on the table in front of you. Or like you're playing whack-a-mole!

---
## ![twisting arrow](app/src/main/res/drawable/twist_arrow.png) **twist it!**
Holding the device out and flat in front of you with the screen facing up, 
move it in a corkscrew motion (either direction) or flip it over so the screen is facing the ground then back.
 
---
## ![pull arrow](app/src/main/res/drawable/pull_arrow.png) **pull it!**
Hold the device facing you and raise it over your head quickly and then back. You may also
hold the device flat (screen up) and move it quickly towards and away from your body

---
## ![eye crossed out](app/src/main/res/drawable/hide_it_icon.png) **hide it!**
This one is easy! Use your other hand to cover the screen. Your hand should be
less than 3 centimeters from your devices screen.

---
## ![snowflake](app/src/main/res/drawable/freeze.png) **FREEZE!**
Don't move for a few seconds!

---
## **TRIVIA!**
Every 5 gesture, a general knowledge true/false trivia question
will appear. Just answer the question correctly to move on!
